# Complete JS Course Website Wiki
## About the course.
This is a course that I purchased from Udemy and I got a good deal on it

This course is focused on Java Script which I think is a good starting point 
for an indepth programming study. So many things are tied to javascript. 

## Current Progress
So far I am working on the first section. 

There are 20 some sections to complete. My goal is to have the course done by the end of January. 
You also get a Certificate upon completion. And all the work I do will be up on github and available
to prospective employers. 

This course starts off very simple so many things I already know but I still want to go over them just to 
review.
