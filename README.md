## About the course.
This is a course that I purchased from Udemy and I got a good deal on it

This course is focused on Java Script which I think is a good starting point 
for an indepth programming study. So many things are tied to javascript. 

## Current Progress
Currently I am on the 14th Section. 
This section is about Object Oriented Programming in Javascript

So far I have learned about Classes and Constructor functions and prototypes and prototype inheritance and creating instances of classes.
