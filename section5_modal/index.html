      <h1>Infinity Begins</h1>

        Infinity begins in an environment overcome by light. Nothing is
        distinguishable, all is ambiguous.

        A great way of clearing out the mind is to imagine yourself as a rock.

        the world. It names the animals and defines the forces of nature in its
        own unique way.
